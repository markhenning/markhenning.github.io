title: The Outage
draft: true

My family dies young, I've know this for years, we always guaranteed to make retirement age but not much after, so when I started out in my career many years ago, I decided that I'd get some breaks in my work life. So I made myself a deal, every 7 years, I'd take 6 months off work to enjoy myself and fill in some bucket list things. In 2013 I spend months travelling across America, from Boston to LA, it was an amazing experience and taught me a lot, I came back re-focused on my career and it's been pretty good.

I know the advice is always "never quit without something lined up", but sometimes you just have to believe in yourself. I got back to it early 2014 and I think I've done some great work since.

So, 2020 rolled round. I normally take a view every 6 months to check in with myself to make sure I'm moving forwards, and actually attempting to reach the goals I set for myself, COV[[the-outage]]ID happened, and I hadn't finished what I wanted to do at FICO, so I stayed there with an amazing team until Feb 2021.



Let's take a look back and what happened, how we fixed it and where we go from here.
In short, I've always had agoraphobia and I'd dealt with it for years, but after a weekends worth of incidents

### The Incident Weekend

First month off started great, I did some home/garden tasks I'd been putting off, got back to running and was moving through some training I'd put off, and then the weekend of March 13/14 happened and things went a bit awry.

There's really two main incidents that happened that weekend, one on each day. 
Saturday, I went out for a walk, 10km loop around the local town as the sun set, it was fine, but I didn't realise how quick the sun was setting and ended up having a panic attack halfway round at the bottom of a large hill. Normally, you just breathe, calm down and move through it, sadly, someone beat me to it...

The golden rule of the first time I spoke to a professional about agoraphobia, there was some training but one clear rule - you have to get back on the horse.

Sunday morning, I went out for a shorter walk the other way, I was tense as I always am after a panic attack, but pressed on. Sadly, about 3km from home, a wonderful driver didn't indicate coming round a corner into the sidestreet I was on, and then just clattered into my arm with a wing mirror. Luckily it wasn't too bad, but when your brain's telling you it's all about to go wrong and then that happens, something breaks, my brain decided it'd had been right all along the world was ending, and now I'm 3km from home, at the bottom of another hill, my arms killing me, and the only thing I need to do is get home.

What followed was not exactly great, I stuck to the safest paths, avoided any up/downs and meandered my way home trying to calm myself down, which suprisingly enough, wasn't working that great!
### Symptoms

I've complained enough about hills now that I think I should supply some details of what actually happens.

Basically, my brain's stupid and can't work out the size of massive things/areas and I need to 

### Moving to a Fix - The Ladder

Enough "woe is me", this isn't about what happened, it's about how we move forwards.

### What Did I Learn?


- Sometimes you've just gotta be kind to yourself - this was a hell of a hole and it took a huge amount of work, but like learning anything it takes time
- You can have all the time in the world, I'll still never finish the garden - if anyone's got a recommendation of a good gardener, I'd appreciate it!!
### Questions I'd ask Me when Hiring

I've interviewed plenty of people before, I know there's always a question around things like this, and from what I've said above my main concern would be that I'd see me as a risk. Sometimes you're not allowed to ask a question, and I understand why, but here's what my answers would be:

**Do you think this could happen again?**
Never say never, but there's three main things here that I'd say:
1. This is mainly an "idle problem" - it happens most when I'm not doing anything other than walking/driving
2. You never forget how to ride a bike, I've spend years training now, even if I did have a "relapse" I know what to do, what the answer is, I know I can deal with it, as I've said above it's not about "what do I do, can I get better?", it's "this doesn't matter, I'll be fine."
3. If you're afraid of rollercoasters, are you scared when you're not on them? If you've had to ride one every day for 4 years, would you still be as scared, or do you think you'd be pretty bored of them by now? Yeah once in a while when I'm somewhere new and open, it's a problem I can deal with, it's not going to happen in cities or offices

**Is this going to cause problems elsewhere in your work?**
If anything I think this has made me far better at coping with stress and dealing with challenges than most, I've had a full on self made intensive course of dealing with absolute panic, it hasn't made me immune to all fear, but it makes you better at coping with anything really, am I worried when a server doesn't reboot? Sure, but it's a molehill compared to what I've been through, let's work the problem

To give a specific example - during my walks across the golf course nearby, I've been chased down by someone waving a golf club around and screaming at me that I'd just stolen his ball. I think anyone would be a bit on edge there, but I watched him close up and just realised it was another problem to deal with, calmed him down and sent him on his way with a smile. It's not my fault he's bad at golf and had lost his ball.

**Are you going to need any special considerations?**
In fact, I'd specifically ask for them not to be any, unless you're planning on asking me to drive 200 miles at night or are going to leave me on my own in the middle of a field,, I think we're good.

### Special Thanks

No one goes through this alone, and I think it's important to credit those people who've put up with my BS for the last few years and have gone out of their way to help me:

- My family, especially those who've come on walks with me multiple times a week
- The Cisco boys - Ji, Rami and Seb, who've always kept me up to date in tech
- Mapes - the man who once described my panicked driving as "brown trousers time" but was kind enough to come with me on my drive to Stanstead, flight and drive home.
- Simon - my old boss who's checked in with me very regularly and given me a glimpse into the real IT world.
- My NHS therapist - absolutely incredibly supportive during the first few weeks and got me up and moving towards the goals.
