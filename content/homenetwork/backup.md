### Goals and Strategies

Backups will always been the ultimate "so what? variable". If they're perfect and work perfect, so what? But if they're not working correctly, you're getting fired.

This is a home network and lab equipment, nothing here has zero downtime requirements, but as with anyone who decided they didn't need a backup will tell you, there's always a time you need it.
